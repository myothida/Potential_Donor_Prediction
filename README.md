# Potential Donor Prediction
This project is inspired by the work done by jindukwentua/Applying-Machine-Learning-to-Charity-donations. 

## Background
Data is critical to any organization, either from private or public sector. In INGO sector, it is known that donation rentention has been reduced lately. To increase the donation amount, it is important to increase the donor retention as regular donors are the ones who will support the organization. 

## Objective
The objective of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to predict the donation amount and to esitmate if the person has potential to donate or not. In short, this project has two components : 1) Classificaiton (potentional donor or not) and 2) Regression (Estimating the donation amount)


## Data
